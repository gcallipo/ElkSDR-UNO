# ElkSDR-UNO
This is a simple SDR receiver based on Elektor SDR module and other two modules: Arduino UNO and DF Robot display &amp; 
buttons for controller.
The SDR_RX_Connection.jpg image and other pictures and video show how to build and connect all the modules.

NOTE:
The last update add a the new tuning functionality, you need a 50K linear potentiometer that feed into A1 pin
the analog voltage to use in tuning feature.

Use the full clockwise and full anticlockwise positions for automatic scan features, internal potentiometer position allow a 
fine tuning of about 1 KHz.
